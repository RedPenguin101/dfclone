Types of Entity:

Creatures: actors. Make decisions about what to do.

Material: objects that are not made of anything else. Rock, Wood,
Glass. They can have different _forms_: natural, block, bar etc. They
do not have 'quality' in and of themselves. They can be _transformed_
into other materials (sand to glass). Or they can be used in
constructions.

Buildings: objects that are made of materials (or produced goods), and
are defined by those materials, as well as their location (buildings
must be placed). Workshops are an example - these are buildings that
can _produce_ (turn maturials into goods). But anything that is placed
is a building: trees are buildigs made of several wood materials. A
special type of building is a "Single Good" Building. This is, in
effect, a Produced Good that has been placed. For example a chair or
table or bed. Any Produced Good can be placed to create a Single Good
Building. Some goods have special properties when placed - for example
a chair confers the 'sittable' attribute. Chests confer the "storage"
attributes.

Produced goods: objects that are made of materials (or other produced
goods) at a Building. They are defined by those materials, but also
have their own qualities, such as illustrations, elaborations etc, as
well has having a general quality (bad, good, excellent).
