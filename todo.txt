Gameplay
--------
BUG: When building something the materials end up in the inventory twice

Filterable stockpiles
Modular productions: menaces with spikes etc.
Model grass and soil floors
Orders: periodically reassess order viability. e.g. produce order is not viable when no workshop is available. In order loop, should occassionaly check if something has opened up. Also, create order loop
Action ticker handling is still not great: Shouldn't pause _after_ finishing mining
BUG: pathing can take you OOB of map
proper time costs for building, mining, moving
More stone types, ores
Charcoal, Smelting
Beds, sleeping
Rooms
When picking up a new work order, the dwarf should have a preference to continue the type of work it's doing, or picking something close. Possibly they should have a boredom threshold and need for variety
Change reference point of workshops to center

Refactor
--------
Give map / entity a better name in game struct

UI/Platform
-----------
Clearer distinction for buttons in menus
Maybe change convention for menus that cancel is always first element
Right click menus on entity - build item in workshop
Better glyph choice for materials
workshop colors should be based on the material they are made of
escape exits back to map mode, always
Pause
Keyboard for mining, building.
Bug: Still getting sleep fails in some places - mostly when the window is defocused
Check for sdl dlls
centralize tear down / rebuild of menus

Map Gen
-------
Proper map size
River
Rock vein generation
Magma
