Non-hardcoded map generation
Proper camera and panning (Bring back basis xforms? Maybe overkill in this context)
Action ticker handling is still not great: Shouldn't pause _after_ finishing mining
BUG: pathing can take you OOB of map
Build item in workshop
Right click menus on entity - build item in workshop
Better glyph choice for materials
workshop colors should be based on the material they are made of
escape exits back to map mode, always
proper time costs for building, mining, moving

Long Term

Basic language features: dictionary for common words
