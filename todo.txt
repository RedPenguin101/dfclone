Build item in workshop ('automanager' centralized style?)
proper time costs for building, mining, moving
More stone types, ores
Charcoal, Smelting
Beds, sleeping
Stockpiles
Rooms

UI
--
Proper camera and panning (Bring back basis xforms? Maybe overkill in this context)
Right click menus on entity - build item in workshop
Better glyph choice for materials
workshop colors should be based on the material they are made of
escape exits back to map mode, always
Pause
