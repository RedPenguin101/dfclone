Reimplement Build function
Reimplement Entity menu
Bug: Crash on lots of mining
Non-hardcoded map generation
Proper camera and panning (Bring back basis xforms? Maybe overkill in this context)
Action ticker handling is still not great: Shouldn't pause _after_ finishing mining
Hover menu showing some detail of the entity/ies and tile under cursor

Build item in workshop
Right click menus on entity - build item in workshop

Long Term
---------
Basic language features: dictionary for common words
Check out RexPaint for ascii sprite definitions

----------
BUG: Can't build 2nd workshop (crash on material selection)
Bug: creature spends a whole tick finding a valid order. Should loop until either valid order or can't find one
