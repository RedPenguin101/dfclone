Bug: Crash on lots of mining
Change UI rendering to have CM basis
Non-hardcoded map generation
Proper camera and panning

Hover menu showing some detail of the entity/ies and tile under cursor

Long Term
---------
Basic language features: dictionary for common words
Check out RexPaint for ascii sprite definitions
Copy Brogue's SDL renderer
