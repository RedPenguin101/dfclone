A dwarf fortress clone as a holiday project
-------------------------------------------

A tile based, indirect action settlement builder game in the style of
dwarf fortress. Just the mechanics, not the personality systems
(though should leave room for expansion in that direction).

TERRAIN: Initially start with a single Z-level. Random generation of
river and mountain within certain parameters.

BUILDINGS: There are two buildings: A workshop which can produce beds
and tables, and a farm plot which produces food.

STOCKPILES can be created, which can be limited to store entities of
particular types.

An ORDER QUEUE system with order types: Mine, Cut trees, Build
building, work in building. Mining produces stone which can be used in
workshops.

Start with 7 dwarves. Dwarves have inventories, and can carry tools.
Dwarves can pick up orders from the order queue system. Dwarves have
sleep and food needs, and will vary their behavior according to those
needs.

Other stuff:

- pathfinding
- graphics: hand drawn tiles, a mouse based UI

Iteration plan:
1: A handdrawn 20x20 fort with 1 dwarf. An order to mine out a single square can be issued from a menu and the dwarf
   will carry out the order
X: Trees and chop trees order
X: Workshop and build bed
X: Farm
X: Stockpile
