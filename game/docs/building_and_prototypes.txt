The characteristics of a building

1. It has a set of material-types which it can be built from (stone, wood)
2. It will be made of a set of materials
3. It can produce a set of recipies

When I select a building to make, I need to

1. Determine which materials are usable for the contruction of that building.
2. Present them to the user in a condensed list, ordered by distance
3. When the user selects the material to use, earmark that material for use
   so it doesn't get picked up by some other process
4. Add that earmarked material to the order for use
