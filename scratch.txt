Building Placement Flow:

1. User places Building shadow, which creates a building entity in the status PendingMaterialAssignment
2. The Entity Menu opens and the user can see available material for construction (or if there is none)
   a) select the nearby material they want to use for the construction
   b) cancel
3. Cancelling removes the building entity and restores the map IM
4. selecting the entity for use will
   a) Update the construction materials of the building
   b) Change the building status to PendingConstruction
   c) Create a build order
   d) return the IM to Map
